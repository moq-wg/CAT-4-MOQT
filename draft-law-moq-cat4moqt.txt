1.  Introduction

   This draft introduces a token-based authentication scheme for use
   with MOQT [MoQTransport].  The scheme protects access to the relay
   during session establishment and also contrains the actions which the
   client may take once connected.

1.1.  Overview of the authentication workflow

   *  An end-user logs-in to a distribution service.  The service
      authenticates the user (via username/password, OAuth, 2FA or
      another method).  The methods involved in this authentication step
      lie outside the scope of this draft.

   *  Based upon the identity and permissions granted to that end-user,
      the service generates a token.  The token encodes information such
      as the user's ID, constraints on how and when they can access the
      MOQT distribution network and contraints on the actions they can
      take once connected.  The token may be signed to make it tamper-
      resistent.

   *  The token is given in the clear to the end-user, along with a URL
      to connect to the edge relay of a MOQT distribution network.

   *  The end-user client application provides the token to the MOQT
      distribution relay when it connects.  This connection may be
      established over WebTransport or raw QUIC.

   *  The relay decrypts the token upon receipt and validates the
      signature, using secrets previously shared between the content
      distributor and the distribution network.  Based upon claims
      conveyed in the token, relay will accept or reject the conneciton.

   *  If the relay accepts the connection, then the client will take a
      series of MOQT actions: ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES, SUBSCRIBE
      or FETCH.  For each of these, it will supply the token it received
      using the AUTHENTICATION parameter.

   *  As an alternative to this workflow, the distribution service may
      vend multiple tokens to the client.  The client may use one of
      those tokens to establish the initial conneciton and others to
      authenticate its actions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
