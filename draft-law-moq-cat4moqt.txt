1.  Introduction

   This draft introduces a token-based authentication scheme for use
   with MOQT [MoQTransport].  The scheme protects access to the relay
   during session establishment and also contrains the actions which the
   client may take once connected.

   This draft defines version 1 of this specification.

1.1.  Overview of the authentication workflow

   *  An end-user logs-in to a distribution service.  The service
      authenticates the user (via username/password, OAuth, 2FA or
      another method).  The methods involved in this authentication step
      lie outside the scope of this draft.

   *  Based upon the identity and permissions granted to that end-user,
      the service generates a token.  A token is a data structure that
      has been serialized into a byte array.  The token encodes
      information such as the user's ID, constraints on how and when
      they can access the MOQT distribution network and contraints on
      the actions they can take once connected.  The token may be signed
      to make it tamper-resistent.

   *  The token is given in the clear to the end-user, along with a URL
      to connect to the edge relay of a MOQT distribution network.

   *  The end-user client application provides the token to the MOQT
      distribution relay when it connects.  This connection may be
      established over WebTransport or raw QUIC.

   *  The relay decrypts the token upon receipt and validates the
      signature, using secrets previously shared between the content
      distributor and the distribution network.  Based upon claims
      conveyed in the token, relay will accept or reject the conneciton.

   *  If the relay accepts the connection, then the client will take a
      series of MOQT actions: ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES, SUBSCRIBE
      or FETCH.  For each of these, it will supply the token it received
      using the AUTHENTICATION parameter.

   *  As an alternative to this workflow, the distribution service may
      vend multiple tokens to the client.  The client may use one of
      those tokens to establish the initial conneciton and others to
      authenticate its actions.

2.  Token format

   This draft uses a single token format, namely the Common Access Token
   (CAT) [CAT].  The token is supplied as a byte array.  When it must be
   cast to a string for inclusion in a URL, it is Base64 encoded
   [BASE64].

   To provide control over the MOQT actions, this draft defines a new
   CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claim called "moqt".  Use of the moqt claim is
   optional for clients.  Support for processing the moqt claim is
   mandatory for relays.

   The default for all actions is "Blocked" and this does not need to be
   communicated in the token.  As soon as a token is provided, all
   actions are explicitly blocked unless explicitly enabled.

2.1.  moqt claim

   The "moqt" claim is defined by the following CDDL:

   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= (moqt-label => moqt-value)
   moqt-label = XXX TODO - how do we register this?
   moqt-value = [ + moqt-object ]

   TODO - need CDDL valid definition.  The moqt token needs to encode
   multiple instances of 4 actions, currently

   *  0 - ANNOUNCE

   *  1 - SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES

   *  2 - PUBLISH

   *  3 - FETCH

   For each action, we need to communicate the permission

   *  0 - Allowed for all Namespaces and Names

   *  1 - Allowed with an exact match

   *  2 - Allowed with a prefix match

   For permissions options 1 & 2, we also need to specify the prefix as
   a byte string.

   *  Prefix - byte string

   Specifying a permission type of 2 or 3 and then not supplying a byte
   string, or supplying a 0 length byte string is equivalent to Blocking
   that action.

   As an alternative to carrying two attributes values for each action,
   we could code these into a single varint to save wire size.

                                 Table 1

2.1.1.  Text examples of permissions to help with CDDL construction

   Example: Allow with an exact match "example.com/bob" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Permits * example.com/bob

   Prohibits * example.com * example.com/bob/123 * example.com/alice *
   example.com/bob/logs * alternate/example.com/bob * 12345
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Example: Allow with a Positive prefix "match example.com/bob"

   Permits
   * example.com/bob
   * example.com/bob/123
   * example.com/bob/logs

   Prohibits
   * example.com
   * example.com/alice
   * alternate/example.com/bob
   * 12345

2.1.2.  Multiple actions

   Multiple actions may be communicated within the same token, with
   different permissions.  The order in which Action/Permission tuples
   are declared and evaluated is unimportant.  The evaluation stops
   after the first Permitted result is discovered.

2.1.2.1.  Example of evaluating multiple actions in the same token:

   *  (1) PUBLISH (Allow with a prefix match) example.com/bob

   *  (2) PUBLISH (Allow with an exact match) example.com/logs/12345/bob

   Evaluating "example.com/bob/123" would succeed on test 1 and test 2
   would never be evaluated.  Evaluating "example.com/logs/12345/bob"
   would fail on test 1 but then succeed on test 2.  Evaluating
   "example.com" would fail on test 1 and on test 2.

3.  Authenticating the connection

   The connection to a MOQT distribution realy can take place over a
   WebTransport or native QUIC connection.  In both cases, the token is
   transferred as a query parameter or else embedded in the URI PATH.

3.1.  Appending a token as a query parameter

   The query parameter name SHOULD be "CAT" (case-sensitive) and the
   query parameter value SHOULD be the Base64 encoded [BASE64] token.
   If more than one token is transferred, then the sequential query
   parameter names "CAT1", "CAT2" .. "CATN" SHOULD be used.

3.2.  Embedding a token in a PATH

   The token SHOULD span only a single PATH component and the component
   SHOULD be prefixed with the string "CAT-".  If more than one token is
   transferred, then they SHOULD occupy different components and SHOULD
   carry sequential prefixes of "CAT1", "CAT2" .. "CATN".

3.3.  Usage with WebTransport

   With a WebTransport connection, the token can be transferred as a
   query parameter or as part of the PATH.

   Example of a single token in a query arg:

   |  https://example.com/
   |  service?CAT=oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=

   Example of multiple tokens in query args:

   |  https://example.com/
   |  service?CAT1=oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=
   |  &CAT2=IHNramRoZmtjc2pkaGYgc2pkaCBhaCBzIGFzS0pEIDthbGtqIA==

   Example of a single token in the PATH

   |  https://example.com/service/CAT-
   |  oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=/

   Example of multiple tokens in the PATH:

   |  https://example.com/service/
   |  CAT1-oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=/CAT2-IHN
   |  ramRoZmtjc2pkaGYgc2pkaCBhaCBzIGFzS0pEIDthbGtqIA==/

3.4.  Usage with Native QUIC

   With a native QUIC connection, the query components and PATH are
   transmitted via the "PATH" parameter in the CLIENT_SETUP message.

   Example of a single token in a query arg:

   |  moqt://203.0.113.0:4443 PATH parameter in the CLIENT_SETUP message
   |  = "service?CAT=oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg="

   Example of multiple tokens in query args:

   |  moqt://203.0.113.0:4443 PATH parameter in the CLIENT_SETUP message
   |  = "service?CAT1=oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=
   |  &CAT2=IHNramRoZmtjc2pkaGYgc2pkaCBhaCBzIGFzS0pEIDthbGtqIA=="

   Example of a single token in the PATH

   |  moqt://203.0.113.0:4443 PATH parameter in the CLIENT_SETUP message
   |  = "service/CAT-oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=/"

   Example of multiple tokens in the PATH:

   |  moqt://203.0.113.0:4443 PATH parameter in the CLIENT_SETUP message
   |  = "service/
   |  CAT1-oRkBDqMAoQBlaHR0cHMDoQFoL2NvbnRlbnQIoQBlLm0zdTg=/CAT2-IHN
   |  ramRoZmtjc2pkaGYgc2pkaCBhaCBzIGFzS0pEIDthbGtqIA==/"
